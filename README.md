Create a public GitHub repository for your mob.

Identify what tool(s) will you use to enable excellent f2f-like collaboration (for remote pair- and mob programming)? 
Document your solution in your repo’s README.               
   > Skype For Business is our collaboration tool
                    
1.Add your Gilded Rose code to your repo (whatever language you choose--default is Java).           
   > Session 1 add Junit tests achieve 100% coverage Sun Feb 10

2.Mob with your teammates to add unit tests until it is safe to refactor the legacy code. To demonstrate that you worked as a mob, 
capture video of your session. Upload your video to YouTube or Vimeo. Document the URL of your video in your repo's README file.        
   > Session 1 video – abridged for size ~1.5hrs to 15 mins : https://youtu.be/NryiiYuI6eE

3.Aim for excellent code coverage of the production code; ignore code coverage of the test code. Take a screenshot of your IDE 
or code coverage tool showing your project's code coverage. Include the screenshot in your git repo as a file named code-coverage.png.

4.Show that all your unit tests pass. Take a screen shot of the JUnit tests in your IDE, showing the list of all unit tests and their results. 
Or copy the console output of your JUnit tests into a text file. Include the screen shot or text file in your git repo. Name the file test-results.png or test-results.txt.

5.Refactor the Gilded Rose production code, removing as many code smells as possible, refactoring for clean code. Your refactored 
Gilded Rose production code should be short and concise. Commit your refactored code to your repo.     
  > Refactored Code in Repo:       https://github.com/emadvaid/6733

6.Add the new feature. Use TDD. Your test method(s) for the new inventory item, Conjured items, must start with the word “conjured”. You 
have at least one test method for Conjured items, and it proves that Conjured items degrade twice as fast as ordinary items. All tests should pass.
